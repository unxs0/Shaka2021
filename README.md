## Background Notes on Radar
Raymarine DSM300 are known to fail...Sometimes you can open it up and find a bad soldering connection...
The DSM's made in Mexico were known to have a high failure rate and voltage sensitivity issues. Raymarine extended the warranty and replaced them with ones that were made in Hungary.
